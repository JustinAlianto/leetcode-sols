        # In a typical graph adjacency list for traversal only,
        # list is the canonical structure â€” because:
        # - The number of neighbors is small on average.
        # - You rarely need O(1) membership checks.
        # - The order and memory layout help recursion performance.

        # Even though lookup (x in set) is O(1), iteration has higher
        # constant overhead due to hash computations and pointer dereferencing.
